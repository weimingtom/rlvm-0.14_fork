The actual syntax of this command permits _seven_ values, not six, but
trailing zeroes can be omitted, and the final one usually is.

They control the values that are named in the debug mode as,
respectively: Layer, SpaceKey, ObjOnOff, TimeMod, DispSort, InitMod, and
WeatherOnOff.

The value 999 is special: it sets the defaults for any objects not
specifically mentioned in an #OBJECT directive.

I know what a few of them do:

* SpaceKey determines whether an object is considered part of the UI
layer or not; if it's non-zero, then the object is hidden temporarily if
the player hides the text window to view the picture properly (typically
by pressing the space key).

* ObjOnOff determines whether an object can be toggled on and off
independently by the player.  Valid values are 0, 1, and 2.  Values of 1
and 2 correspond to [Set]ShowObject1() and [Set]ShowObject2(), and to
#SYSCOMs 18 and 19 respectively.

* WeatherOnOff determines whether the object is considered a weather
effect object or not; if it's non-zero, the object will be shown and
hidden with [Set]ShowWeather(), #SYSCOM 17.

Default visibility of ObjOnOff and WeatherOnOff are configured with
#INIT_OBJECT1_ONOFF_MOD, #INIT_OBJECT2_ONOFF_MOD, and
#INIT_WEATHER_ONOFF_MOD, where values of 0 mean that the objects are
visible by default, and values of 1 mean they are invisible.  These
default settings are only used at first launch, after which the player's
choices are stored in the global environment saved data.

The others remain obscure, I'm afraid.
