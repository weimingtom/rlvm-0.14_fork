buf = obj buffer to work with
<count> = number of copies of our drift file to show.
<use animation> = whether to animate 
<start pattern> = first consequitive frame g00 pattern to show,
                  or only pattern to show if use animation false.
<end pattern> = last consequitive frame g00 pattern to show
<pattern time> = Time it takes to display full sequence.

yspeed = Time it takes to go from the top of the screen to the
         bottom of the screen

<period> = Period of a sine wave added to our position.
           When 0, no sine wave is added.
<amplitude> = Amplitude of the sine wave. When 0, no sine wave
              is added. 1 is the largest possible amplitude. I am not
              really sure about units here.

<use drift> = A boolean flag on whether to add a semi-random drift to the 
<drift pattern> = Defines how drift is applied. 
       0 = ?
       2 = 
       3 = Steady leftwards movement?
       4 = Steady leftwards movement
<driftspeed> = Time in milliseconds that it takes to move leftwards across the screen.

x, y, x', y' = Can all be -1 to specify the full screen.
